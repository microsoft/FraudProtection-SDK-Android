When you implement Fraud Protection device fingerprinting by instrumenting your Android application with a Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection SDK for Android, you (i) agree to Microsoft’s APIs terms of use located at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/microsoft-apis/terms-of-use, and (ii) you direct Microsoft to process the following types of data from the devices interacting with the Fraud Protection services (collectively, “Device Fingerprinting Data”): 

1. Device attributes such as device ID, screen information, processor class, etc. 

2. Operating system (OS) attributes, such as OS information, OS version, OEM details, etc. 

3. Browser related attributes, if applicable, such as browser language, installed default apps, etc. 

It is your responsibility to:  

1. Receive consent from your users to collect and allow Microsoft to process the Device Fingerprinting Data. 

2. Inform your customers of your data collection and processing practices, for example by disclosing the data you collect and how it is used. 

3. Disclose your use of third parties working on your behalf to process the data you collect, including Fraud Protection service providers. 

4. Comply with all laws and regulations applicable to the use of Fraud Protection, including data protection laws.
